# Automatic classification of UVES calibration images

## General Goals

- Develop a method to supplement the visual spot check of calibration images done during daytime by experts. The method should identify anomalous images.

- Knowledge transfer on ML techniques from MetricArts to ESO team to work

## Technical goal

- Design a method to detect anomalous and defectuous images based on Deep Learning and clustering techniques

## Resources

- Microsoft Azure environment
- Azure storage container
- CPU and GPU VM
- Jupyterlab
- Tensorflow framework
